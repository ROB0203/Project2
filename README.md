# Project2
Split the data set into train and test with ratio 8:2.
Used SVM with following kernels: Linear, Polynomial (degree 3), Radial Basis Function (gamma = 0.5), and Sigmoid and computed their accuracies.
Visualized the performance of test accuracy on all kernels.
In RBF, comparatively analysed on gamma = 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 0.9 and visualized the data.
